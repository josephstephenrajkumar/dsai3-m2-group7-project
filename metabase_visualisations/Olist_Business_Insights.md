**CUSTOMERS TAB**

**1\. Customer Geographic Concentration**

Customers are **heavily concentrated in a small number of states and cities**, with Sao Paulo dominating customer volume, followed by other major urban regions

**Business implications**

- Revenue is **urban-driven**, meaning logistics, marketing, and seller acquisition strategies should prioritize top metro areas.
- There is **growth potential in underpenetrated states**, where customer acquisition costs may be lower.

**Action**

- Expand localized promotions and faster delivery promises in high-density cities.
- Pilot marketing campaigns in mid-tier states to diversify demand.

**2\. Customer Base Skews Toward One-Time Buyers**

The dashboard indicates that the majority of customers place **only one order**, while repeat customers form a much smaller segment

**Business implications**

- Customer acquisition is working, but **retention is weak**.
- Lifetime value (LTV) is likely lower than it could be.

**Action**

- Introduce post-purchase incentives (discounts on second order).
- Use email/WhatsApp remarketing for customers after successful delivery.
- Segment customers by first-purchase category to personalize follow-ups.

**3\. Order Volume Is Uneven Across Customers**

A small subset of customers contributes **multiple orders**, while most contribute minimally

**Business implications**

- There is a **power-user segment** worth protecting and growing.
- Losing these customers would disproportionately impact revenue.

**Action**

- Create loyalty tiers for high-frequency customers.
- Offer early access or free shipping for repeat buyers.

**4\. Delivery Experience Strongly Influences Satisfaction**

Customer review scores on the dashboard correlate with **delivery performance**, especially on-time vs late delivery

**Business implications**

- Logistics quality directly affects customer perception.
- Late deliveries risk churn and negative word-of-mouth.

**Action**

- Prioritize sellers and carriers with strong delivery SLAs.
- Flag late deliveries for proactive customer communication or compensation.

**5\. Customer Distribution Reflects Infrastructure Strength**

Regions with higher customer density align closely with areas of **stronger logistics infrastructure**

**Business implications**

- Scaling into new regions requires **logistics readiness**, not just marketing.
- Poor infrastructure regions may drive lower satisfaction scores.

**Action**

- Evaluate fulfilment centre placement based on customer clusters.
- Partner with regional logistics providers before scaling marketing spend.

**Executive Summary**

**What the dashboard tells us overall:**

- Customer demand is **geographically concentrated**
- Acquisition is strong, but **retention is the main weakness**
- Delivery performance is a **key driver of customer satisfaction**
- A small group of repeat customers represents **high strategic value**

**SELLERS TAB**

**1\. Seller Distribution Is Highly Skewed**

**Most sellers contribute very few orders**, while a small minority accounts for a large share of total sales volume

**Business implications**

- Platform revenue depends disproportionately on a **small core of high-performing sellers**.
- Seller churn in this top tier would materially impact GMV.

**Action**

- For "top sellers", offer account management, fee incentives, or logistics benefits to retain them.

**2\. Seller Geographic Clustering Mirrors Customer Demand**

Sellers are heavily clustered in **economically strong and logistics-ready regions**, particularly large urban states

**Business implications**

- Supply is strongest where demand already exists, reinforcing regional concentration.
- Underserved regions may face longer delivery times and poorer customer experience.

**Action**

- Incentivize seller onboarding in underrepresented regions.
- Use reduced commissions or fulfilment support to rebalance supply.

**3\. Delivery Performance Varies Significantly by Seller**

There is clear variation in **delivery lead time and delays across sellers**

**Business implications**

- Seller operational quality directly affects customer satisfaction.
- Poor-performing sellers introduce platform-wide reputation risk.

**Action**

- Introduce seller performance scorecards (on-time %, avg delay).
- Penalize or coach consistently late sellers.
- Preferentially surface high-performing sellers in search/ranking.

**4\. Seller Performance Correlates with Review Scores**

Higher-performing sellers tend to receive **better customer review scores**, while sellers with delivery issues cluster around lower ratings

**Business implications**

- Review score is a reliable proxy for seller operational health.
- Low-rated sellers likely drive higher refund, churn, and support costs.

**Action**

- Set minimum rating thresholds for promotions or featured listings.
- Proactively intervene when seller ratings decline.

**5\. Long-Tail Sellers Add Variety but Limited Volume**

The dashboard suggests many sellers are **low-volume, long-tail contributors**

**Business implications**

- These sellers increase assortment breadth but not GMV.
- Operational overhead may outweigh their revenue contribution.

**Action**

- Segment sellers into:
  - Core revenue sellers
  - Growth-potential sellers
  - Long-tail / low-activity sellers
- Automate onboarding and support for low-volume sellers to reduce costs.

**Combined Customer + Seller Insight (Strategic View)**

When combining both dashboards:

- **Customer satisfaction is tightly linked to seller delivery performance**
- **Revenue concentration risk exists on both sides** (few customers, few sellers)
- Logistics and seller quality are the **core levers for growth**, not just marketing

**Executive Takeaways**

- Protect and grow **top sellers**
- Actively manage **low-performing sellers**
- Expand seller base strategically to reduce geographic and operational risk
- Use seller metrics (delivery, reviews) directly in ranking and promotion logic

**PRODUCTS TAB**

**1\. Sales Are Concentrated in a Few Product Categories**

The dashboard shows that **a small number of product categories dominate total orders and revenue**, while many categories contribute marginal volume

**Business implications**

- Revenue is highly dependent on **core categories**.
- Category-level shocks (supply issues, seasonality) could impact GMV.

**Action**

- Protect top categories with priority seller onboarding and inventory availability.
- Diversify by promoting fast-growing secondary categories.

**2\. Long-Tail Products Increase Assortment, Not Revenue**

Most products receive **very low order counts**, confirming a strong long-tail effect

**Business implications**

- Wide assortment boosts perceived choice but adds complexity.
- Carrying too many low-volume SKUs increases operational cost.

**Action**

- Apply differentiated logistics and storage policies.
- Consider delisting or deprioritizing persistently inactive SKUs.

**3\. Product Weight and Size Drive Logistics Performance**

Heavier and bulkier products show **longer delivery times and higher delay rates**

**Business implications**

- Logistics cost and customer satisfaction vary significantly by product type.
- Uniform shipping SLAs are inefficient.

**Action**

- Introduce category-specific delivery promises.
- Adjust shipping fees or seller requirements for heavy items.

**4\. Price Distribution Shows Strong Mid-Range Clustering**

Most products are priced in a **mid-range band**, with fewer premium or ultra-low-priced items

**Business implications**

- Platform competes primarily on **value-for-money**, not luxury.
- Upsell opportunities exist for premium segments.

**Action**

- Create premium category badges or curated collections.
- Encourage bundles to increase AOV in mid-priced categories.

**5\. Review Scores Vary Significantly by Category**

Some categories consistently achieve **higher customer review scores**, while others underperform

**Business implications**

- Poorly rated categories may drive churn despite high sales.
- Quality issues may be systemic within certain categories.

**Action**

- Investigate seller and logistics performance by category.
- Set stricter seller quality controls in low-rated categories.

**Cross-Dashboard Strategic Insight (Customers + Sellers + Products)**

When all three dashboards are viewed together:

- **Top product categories + top sellers + urban customers** drive most GMV.
- Long-tail products and sellers add variety but dilute operational focus.

**Executive Summary**

- Protect and optimize **core product categories**
- Improve weak categories by **upgrading seller quality**
- Use product data to drive pricing, bundling, and AOV growth
